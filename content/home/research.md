My dissertation explores how *data-intensive and algorithmic technologies*, and their concentration in the hands of a few corporate players, are transforming *discretionary decision-making* in financial and legal institutions and in so doing, changing the dynamics of the circulation and accumulation of wealth and information in society.
* **How should we regulate artificial intelligence and the data industry? How must we adapt existing laws for the new information regimes that characterize a digital, hyperconnected world?**
* Can we remedy the great asymmetries of power of today's digital economy and achieve a more democratic governance of data and algorithms?
* To answer these questions, we need a better understanding of how information, computation and communication technologies and practices interplay with social and legal institutions and impact social decision-making and collective intelligence. 
* My dissertation works towards this through two complementary projects exploring different fields of *human-AI interaction*: 
	* **adjudication** decisions in courts, and 
	* **investment** decisions in financial markets.

* <span style="color: #eab676">"***Divestment without Decarbonization: Private Equity and the Organizational Ecology of Dirty Work***"</span> (co-authored with [Adam Goldstein](https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/adam-goldstein)): CO2-equivalent emissions from the U.S. industrial sector have remained remarkably stable in recent years, despite growing pressures for firms to adopt more sustainable business practices. Drawing on theories of means-ends decoupling and organizational fissuring as a mechanism of liability avoidance, we hypothesize that intensified financial, reputational, and regulatory pressures are prompting publicly-traded firms to shed environmental liabilities by divesting carbon-emitting assets. However, rather than reducing net emissions, carbon-intensive plants are relocating to more opaque privately-owned and private equity firms, which face fewer pressures to decarbonize. The result, we suggest, is a dynamic of divestment without decarbonization. We test this by constructing a unique linked dataset covering the period from 2010-2021 for the universe of more than 8000 facilities that reported emissions data to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, with time-varying data on the ownership of each facility’s parent firm. We presented this project at [SASE 2023](https://sase.org/event/2023-rio-de-janeiro/) in Rio.

* <span style="color: #eab676">"***The Real Effect of Analyst Forecasts: Managing Earnings and Uncertainty in Non-Financial Firms***"</span>: In this empirical project, I investigate earnings management practices and share repurchase operations by U.S. publicly traded firms over the past 20 years. I rely on new statistical analyses of corporate data covering the period of 1999 to 2019 combined with past findings from qualitative researchers to explore the dynamics of managers’ earnings guidance and sell-side analysts’ earnings forecasts, and the relational construction of earnings surprises. I replicate and extend previously published results in financial econometrics by showing that, contrary to what has been suggested, earnings surprises cannot be used as a causal instrument in most cases, given their embeddedness within managerial decision-making processes. More broadly, I discuss when and why endogeneity problems may result from using as an instrument or treatment a variable that encodes prediction practices within the field studied.

* <span style="color: #eab676">"***Legal Non-Cases: Québec’s Pleas in Bar and the Changing Face of Judges as Arbiters of Fairness***"</span>: In this working paper, which I presented at [LSA](https://www.lawandsociety.org/) 2022 in Lisbon, Portugal, I follow an unusual, hybrid legal doctrine--discretionary pleas in bar--through Canadian, French, and English legal documents spanning 300 years, as it emerges as a tool for creditors but eventually becomes a shield protecting debtors. When black-letter law grants rights, judges can rely on various mechanisms to prevent rights holders from asserting them at the expense of other rights, fundamental values, or practical concerns. Pleas in bar are one. By making otherwise valid claims entirely ineffective, they transform legal cases into non-cases. Their study provides insight on how judges reconcile the *socially intolerable* with the *legally unenforceable* in contract law and offers a window into the dynamic interplay between law, society, and political economy. </font>

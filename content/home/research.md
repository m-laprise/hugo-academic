My **dissertation** investigates the law and political economy of information after the digital turn, and how traders of debt and data are reshaping economic forecasting and moral evaluation practices, and in so doing, changing the face of corporate power.
* How can we remedy the great [asymmetries](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/2852/) of [power](https://www.benkler.org/Degrees_of_Freedom_Dimensions_of_Power_Final.pdf) of today's digital economy? How can we achieve a more democratic ordering of data as a [collective resource](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance)? Can reforming the [legal infrastructure](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691208602/the-code-of-capital) of [informational capitalism](https://juliecohen.com/between-truth-and-power/) help to reduce social and economic inequality and to sustain participatory democracy? 
* Answering these urgent questions requires casting light on the inner workings of the beating heart of the digital economy: the *data and analytics industry*. 
* My dissertation looks at the firms, lawyers, engineers, and data scientists involved in the global data and analytics industry. It examines what law and technology they rely on, how they combine relational, legal, and algorithmic work to control and process flows of information, and how they create and manage markets for data and predictions.

* <span style="color: #eab676">"*Value for Whom? The Complex Relation between Payout Choices and Consumer Harm in the U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry*"</span>: In this empirical project, I investigate earnings management practices and share repurchase operations in the U.S. pharmaceutical, healthcare, and biotechnology sector over the past 20 years, and assess the cumulative impact of managers' payout choices on consumer unsafety and product liability.

* <span style="color: #eab676">"*Delinquent Debtors, Deceitful Creditors, or Doubtful Judges? Legal Non-cases and Fairness in Contract Enforcement*"</span>: In this working paper, which I presented at [LSA](https://www.lawandsociety.org/) 2022 in Lisbon, Portugal, I follow an unusual, hybrid legal doctrine--discretionary pleas in bar--through Canadian, French, and English legal documents spanning 300 years, as it emerges as a tool for creditors but eventually becomes a shield protecting debtors. When black-letter law grants rights, judges can rely on various mechanisms to prevent rights holders from asserting them at the expense of other rights, fundamental values, or practical concerns. Pleas in bar are one. By making otherwise valid claims entirely ineffective, they transform legal cases into non-cases. Their study provides insight on how judges reconcile the *socially intolerable* with the *legally unenforceable* in contract law and offers a window into the dynamic interplay between law, society, and political economy. </font>

I have designed a {{% staticref "uploads/syllabus01.pdf" %}}syllabus and course guide{{% /staticref %}} for a 12-week seminar on **Law, Society, and Political Economy**, to introduce upper-level undergraduates or first-year J.D. or business school students students to existing scholarship and promising research methods on how legal institutions shape social and economic relations and create corporate power and social inequality, with a focus on North America in the past 200 years.

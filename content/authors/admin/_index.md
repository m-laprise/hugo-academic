I am a PhD candidate at Princeton University, where I combine computational methods with legal analysis and social theory to study the **impact of machine learning on social decision-making**. My research at the interface of *law*, *sociology*, and *computer science and engineering* investigates corporate power in the **data and analytics industry** and **human-AI interaction** in courts and financial markets. In the process of doing that work, I also tinker with local language models and think about how they can be made smaller and more helpful to researchers and communities, rather than large corporations.

I am a co-PI at Princeton's [Debt Collection Lab](https://debtcollectionlab.org/), where I study debt collection lawsuits and inequality in the United States and help make data about private debt collectors accessible to the greater public, and a co-founder of the Princeton chapter of the [Law and Political Economy (LPE) Project](https://lpeproject.org/).

I am a lawyer in Quebec (Canada), where I practiced in civil and commercial litigation for five years. Before coming to Princeton, I was at the Faculty of Law of the University of Montreal, where I studied the interaction of codified law and moral considerations in judicial decision-making and its relation to socioeconomic history. My [thesis](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3812636), which combined comparative-historical and doctrinal analyses to theorize judicially created barriers to legal action, has won the 2022 [excellence prize](https://apdq.openum.ca/prix/recipiendaires-des-prix-de-theses-et-de-memoires-2008-2021/) of the Quebec Association of Law Professors.

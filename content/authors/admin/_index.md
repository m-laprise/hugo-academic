I am a PhD candidate at Princeton University, where I am also completing a graduate certificate at the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning. I study the impact of **machine learning** on **social decision-making**, with a focus on markets and regulation. My work at the interface of *AI*, *finance*, *law*, and *sociology* asks how data-driven technologies are reconfiguring flows and distributions of information and wealth, in **financial markets** and beyond. I also investigate complex reasoning in **large language models** and evaluate whether and how they can be successful at legal reasoning.

I am a co-PI at Princeton's [Debt Collection Lab](https://debtcollectionlab.org/), where our team studies debt collection lawsuits and inequality in the United States and help make data about private debt collectors accessible to the greater public.

In the private sector, I practiced as a **commercial trial lawyer** in downtown Montreal (Canada) for five years. I handled high-stakes litigation involving shareholder rights, complex tax planning, and trademark infringement, I advised business owners on their litigation risks, and I participated in a variety of corporate transactions.

Before coming to Princeton, I was at the Faculty of Law of the University of Montreal, where I studied judicial discretion and decision-making by judges and courts, and its relation to socioeconomic history. My [thesis](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3812636) has won the 2022 [excellence prize](https://apdq.openum.ca/prix/recipiendaires-des-prix-de-theses-et-de-memoires/) of the Quebec Association of Law Professors.

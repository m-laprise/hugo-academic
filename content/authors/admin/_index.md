I am a legal scholar and PhD student in sociology at Princeton University, where I focus on the socio-legal study of corporate power, relations of debt and credit, and informational capitalism. My current research combines advanced quantitative and computational methods with doctrinal and comparative-historical analyses to investigate how legal infrastructures construct the economy and to understand the distributional patterns and social consequences they generate.

I am also a lawyer in Quebec (Canada), where I practiced in civil and commercial litigation for five years. Before coming to Princeton, I studied the interaction of codified law and moral considerations in judges' reasoning, its relation to socioeconomic history, and its impacts on substantive law. My [thesis](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3812636) combined comparative-historical and doctrinal analyses to theorize the emergence, scope, and purpose of judicially created barriers to legal action in Quebec private law.

I am a PhD candidate in sociology at Princeton University, where I focus on the socio-legal study of corporate power, forecasting and valuation practices, and traders of debt and data in the digital economy. My research combines qualitative and computational methods to investigate how legal infrastructures construct the economy and to understand the social consequences they generate. I am a lawyer in Quebec (Canada), where I practiced in civil and commercial litigation for five years. 

I am also a co-PI at Princeton's [Debt Collection Lab](https://debtcollectionlab.org/), where I study debt collection lawsuits and inequality in the United States and help make data about private debt collectors accessible to the greater public, and a co-founder of the Princeton chapter of the [Law and Political Economy (LPE) Project](https://lpeproject.org/).

Before coming to Princeton, I was at the Faculty of Law of the University of Montreal, where I studied the interaction of codified law and moral considerations in judges' reasoning, its relation to socioeconomic history, and its impacts on substantive law. My [thesis](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3812636), which combined comparative-historical and doctrinal analyses to theorize judicially created barriers to legal action in Quebec, has won the 2022 [excellence prize](https://apdq.openum.ca/prix/recipiendaires-des-prix-de-theses-et-de-memoires-2008-2021/) of the Quebec Association of Law Professors.
